            <h2>What is AYSII?</h2>
            <p>- AYSII or Access Your Schoolworks In an Instant is a teacher-</p>
            <p> exclusive website that is used to send how many schoolworks </p>
            <p> an absentee student has missed. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Why made AYSII?</h2>
            <p>- Because we have observed that a lot of teachers are having a hard time trying to </p>
            <p> communicate to their students about their missing schoolworks, especially those who are </p>
            <p> absent frequently, and also the fact that there are a lot of </p>
            <p> students a teacher has to deal with. With this in mind, this </p>
            <p> is way that we can help teachers in communicating it </p>
            <p> conveniently and efficiently.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>How we made AYSII?</h2>
            <p>- We made AYSII through PHP, a programming language </p>
            <p>  that is vital in the functionality of the website. </p>
            <p>  We also made it with HTML (another programming language, sort of), XAMPP, </p>
            <p>   a hosting server, and MySQL, which is used to make our databases for our website.</p>
